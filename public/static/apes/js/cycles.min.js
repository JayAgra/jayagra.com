These are carbon-rich sources of energy, mainly being coal, gas, and oil. We use these to do many things that we find to be essential with the current way we live.

Some factors that affect this are the salinity and temperature of the water. During rain, water can travel over soil surfaces and carry away carbon into various bodies of water, eventually going into the sea. The largest carbon sink on the planet, capable of storing 50 times as much carbon than the atmosphere. Due to the increased carbon from burning fossil fuels, when the ocean takes in all this extra carbon the pH levels drop. The decrease in pH levels is called ocean acidification, which can cause trouble for organisms that need to build their shells or skeletons.</p>"},{title:"Aquatic Life",brief:"Aquatic Food Chain and Decomposition.",html:"<p>When living organisms break down sugars for energy, they take in O<sub>2</sub> and release CO<sub>2</sub> back into the water and the gas dissolves. Plants absorb the CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere through photosynthesis to create sugars, they then release O<sub>2</sub>. Aquatic plants take in CO<sub>2</sub> mainly from its dissolved form in water. When organisms die, they release the carbon that was stored within them back into the environment. Decomposers play a large role in this process, breaking down the dead organisms and returning nutrients to the environment.</p>"}]},{title:"Water",copyright:"Leviathan Padwick",base_image:"./static/apes/src/h/bkg.png",layer_images:["./static/apes/src/h/0000.png","./static/apes/src/h/0001.png","./static/apes/src/h/0002.png","./static/apes/src/h/0003.png","./static/apes/src/h/0004.png","./static/apes/src/h/0005.png"],steps:[{title:"All",brief:"The water cycle ensures the availability of water for all living things.",html:"<p>The water cycle is an extremely important process as it enables the availability of water for all living organisms and regulates weather patterns on Earth.

The water is transferred from its liquid state into its gaseous form, called water vapor. This occurs when the molecules in a mass of water obtain enough kinetic energy to eject themselves from the water surface. The main factors affecting evaporation are temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation. Sublimation is the direct transition of water from a solid state to a gaseous state. This contributes to the water cycle by adding water vapor to the atmosphere, mainly in cold climates as snow and ice may sublimate rather than melting. Transpiration is the loss of water from the soil, this can be combined with evaporation for evapotranspiration. Transpiration is when water is lost through the stomata, a part of the plant's leaves. Solar radiation, atmospheric vapor pressure, temperature, wind, and soil moisture can affect the rate of evapotranspiration. Evapotranspiration accounts for most of the water lost from the soil during the growth of crops. Finally, the transition process from vapor state to liquid state is called condensation. It can take place as soon as the air contains more water vapor than it can receive from a water surface. The water vapor is released in the form of precipitation. Forms of condensation include fog and dew. Fog is when the water vapor condenses in the air near ground, this is also a type of cloud. Dew is when water vapor condenses on cool surfaces.</p>"},{title:"Precipitation",brief:"How water comes back down to the surface.",html:"<p>Precipitation is all liquid and solid water particles that fall from clouds and reach the ground.

This is a crucial step in the water cycle as infiltration replenishes groundwater. Soil type, vegetation cover, and precipitation are factors that can affect infiltration. Groundwater flows through underground aquifers, which are porous and permeable rock layers that hold and transmit water.  It can also flow into streams, rivers, or the ocean.

Runoff includes not only the waters that travel over the land surface and through channels to reach a stream but also interflow, the water that infiltrates the soil surface and travels by means of gravity toward a stream channel and eventually empties into the channel. Runoff also includes groundwater that is discharged into a stream; streamflow that is composed entirely of groundwater is termed base flow, or fair-weather runoff, and it occurs where a stream channel intersects the water table. Glacier and snow runoff contribute greatly to global sea levels as the sea levels rise due to the melting glaciers runoff. Distributing groundwater storage involves replenishing water in aquifers for various purposes including maintaining water supply, improving water quality, and managing flood risk. </p>"},{title:"Ocean Water Storage",brief:"How the ocean stores water and where the water cycle starts.",html:"<p>The ocean stores roughly 97% of earth's water.
